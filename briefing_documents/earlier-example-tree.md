 # AI Chatbot Implementation Decision Guide for HNW Banking

 **Executive Summary**
 High-Net-Worth (HNW) customer service demands 24/7, deeply personal support. Agents face high burnout, and the bank seeks to deploy an AI assistant (“Mr Bob”) to extend agent capacity while preserving compliance, brand integrity, and service quality. This guide walks senior leaders through an end-to-end decision process covering:
 - Governance & business readiness
 - Compliance & security
 - Technology design choices (flows, guardrails, tone, state)
 - Human-in-the-loop handover
 - Pilot execution & continuous improvement

 ## High-Level Flow
 ```
 START -> 1) Org & Business Readiness? -> 2) Compliance & Security? -> 3) Known & Predictable Qs? -> 4) Harm/Off-limits? -> 5) Tone/Persona? -> 6) Multi-step/Stateful? -> 7) Human-in-the-Loop? -> 8) Pilot & Continuous Improvement -> (Feedback to 3–7)

 ## Detailed Steps

 1) **Org & Business Readiness?**
    - **No**: Workshop to define:
      - Business case (e.g. agent burnout, CSAT, TCO)
      - Success metrics/KPIs (handle time, retention, ROI targets)
      - Org-change plan (executive sponsorship, stakeholder alignment, training, comms, escalation)
    - **Yes**: Proceed to step 2

 2) **Compliance & Security?**
    - **No**: Conduct:
      - Data-privacy & security impact assessment
      - Regulatory & legal reviews (audit trails, record-keeping, disclaimers)
    - **Yes**: Proceed to step 3

 3) **Known & Predictable Questions?**
    - **Yes**:
      - Sensitive / brand-critical?
        - **Yes** → Intent Tables + Preset Topics + RAG
        - **No**  → Buttons / Suggestion Chips for rapid, guided responses
    - **No**:
      - Absolute factual accuracy required?
        - **Yes** → RAG (retrieve and ground answers in internal docs)
        - **No**  → GPT-generated open responses + human fallback

 4) **Harm & Off-limits Guardrails?**
    - **Yes** → Alert Words + Moderation layer on inputs/outputs
    - **No**  → Light guardrails & tone guidance

 5) **Tone & Persona?**
    - **Yes** → Custom prompts with persona profile & few-shot examples
    - **No**  → Default neutral tone + standard guardrails

 6) **Multi-step / Stateful?**
    - **Yes** → Memory handling or scripted chaining for workflows (onboarding, KYC)
    - **No**  → Stateless Q&A only

 7) **Human-in-the-Loop & Handover?**
    - Define confidence thresholds (e.g. confidence < X triggers handover)
    - Establish SLAs, escalation paths & agent training for smooth takeover

 8) **Pilot & Continuous Improvement**
    - Launch a pilot cohort with live users
    - Monitor dashboards (CSAT, fallback rates, error trends)
    - Set regular review cadence to:
      - Retrain models and update scripts/guardrails
      - Expand scope and scale

 **Notes:**
 - Steps 1 & 2 are prerequisites—complete them before detailed design.
 - Steps 3–7 can run in parallel by dedicated workstreams.
 - Step 8 creates a feedback loop into Steps 3–7 for continuous refinement.

 ## Glossary
 - **Intent Tables**: Maps user intents (e.g. “update address”) to approved response templates.
 - **Preset Topics**: Clickable menu items (e.g. “Wealth Review,” “Tax Planning”).
 - **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation—retrieve relevant docs then generate answers grounded in them.
 - **Buttons / Suggestion Chips**: Quick-reply UI elements steering conversation into tested paths.
 - **Alert Words / Moderation**: Filters & policies to block or flag harmful or off-limits content.
 - **Guardrails**: Confidence thresholds and fallback rules triggering human handover.
 - **Memory Handling**: Session-state management to support multi-step flows.
 - **Pilot & CI**: Dashboards, structured reviews, and retraining cycles to detect drift and scale responsibly.
